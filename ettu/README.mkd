# ettu

ettu is a recursive DNS brute-forcer that tries to avoid dead-ends.

Like all tools in my hacks repo it's alpha-quality (at best) so you're
likely to find rough edges. I'd still like to hear about issues with
it though.

## Install

```
go install -v github.com/tomnomnom/hacks/ettu@latest
```

## Usage

```
usage: ettu [--depth=<int>] <domain> [<wordfile>|-]
```

### Examples

```
▶ cat wordlist | ettu --depth=2 example.com 
```

```
▶ ettu example.com wordlist
```


## Dead-end Avoidance

Ordinarily if there are no records to return for a DNS name you might expect an `NXDOMAIN` error:

```
▶ host four.tomnomnom.uk
Host four.tomnomnom.uk not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
```

You may have noticed that sometimes you get an empty response instead though:

```
▶ host three.tomnomnom.uk
```

The difference in the latter case is often that another name - one that has your queried name as a suffix -
exists and has records to return:

```
▶ host one.two.three.tomnomnom.uk
one.two.three.tomnomnom.uk has address 46.101.59.42
```

This difference in response can be used to help avoid dead-ends in recursive DNS
brute-forcing by not recursing in the former situation:

```
▶ echo -e "www\none\ntwo\nthree" | ettu tomnomnom.uk
one.two.three.tomnomnom.uk
```
